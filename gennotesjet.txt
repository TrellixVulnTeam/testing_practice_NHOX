-Specifically made for React in mind, close to ReactJS philosophy
-Not for the browser, unit test focused
-Based on JSDom, built on top of Jasmine (similar to the protractor I was using)
-"Zero configuration", for react at least

-How about mocha?
  -"Jest is best for components, mocha is best for business logic"
    -"Business logic" So mocha  is for the backend?
      -"Business logic or domain logic is that part of the program which encodes
      the real-world business rules that determine how data can be created, displayed,
       stored, and changed.
    -"Business logic tends to run on both client and server. "
  -Mocha runs on client and server
  -Can run end to end


-Chimp
  -You can use Cucumber, jasmine or mocha
